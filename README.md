You need to write a program that receives 12 numbers separated by space from the user. 
The 12 input numbers will correspond to the 12 terminal nodes of the tree from left to right. 
Your program should print the index of the terminal states that will be pruned using the alpha-beta search algorithm. 
The indexes are fixed and are shown in the figure below (0 to 11).
